MrPhil’s Ludum Dare 40 compo entry: The Prison Maze of Ozxu, a Roguelike Tower Defense game. 
You play as a mage who’s been imprisoned in Ozxu, a maze built as a prison for criminals with magic abilities.
You’ve been restrained in cursed handcuffed limiting the spells you can cast and the few spells you can,
will be necessary to defend yourself from the prison’s Keepers which grow stronger with each spell you cast.
No one has ever esacped, maybe you are different.

You've imprisoned in special kind of prision for criminals with magic abilities, a Prision Maze.
You’ve been restrained with a cursed breast plate limiting the spells you can cast.  The few spells you can,
will be necessary to defend yourself from the prison’s Keepers, magical Golems who's ranks grow stronger
with each spell you cast.
No one has ever esacped a Prison Maze, but you are different!  Maybe.
